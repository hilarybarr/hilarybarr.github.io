				<h2> Conflict </h2>
				<h3> May 15, 2014 by Hilary </h3>
			
 		</br> <strong> Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? </strong></br>
 		I can't remember the last time I had an emotional conflict with anyone other than in my love life (but that would be too personal 
 		to talk about here, now wouldn't that? :-))  Yet I do have an emotional conflict with myself from time to time when I don't feel I am doing something as well as I should be. The instance that comes to mind is when I applied for an early admission medical
 		school program my freshman year of college. When I didn't get in, it initially made me question my worth.

 		</br></br> <strong> What was the source of the conflict? </strong></br>
 		The conflict stemmed from my perfectionism and occasionally being unrealistic in my expectations for myself.

 		</br> </br></i> <strong> How did you handle that conflict? </strong></br>
		My behavior initially fell along the "Attack Self" part of the Compass of Shame. I ultimately realized that the rejection turned out to be one of the best things that happened to me. I had planned on becoming a doctor since I was a kid, so this was the first time that I took a step back and questioned whether this the right path for me. This period of introspection made me realize that medicine was not in fact my calling. I became extremely thankful for the rejection, and decided that from then on I would view situations like that as learning experiences.


 		</br></br> <strong> Did your actions make the conflict better or worse? </strong></br>
 		Being so hard on myself didn't really change anything, which was a part of the lesson for me. All I was able to do was continue to try my best at anything I applied myself to in the future.


 		</br></br> <strong> If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything? </strong></br>
 		I wouldn't have been so hard on myself.


 		</br></br><strong> What did you learn from this experience? </strong></br>
 		I learned that sometimes rejections turn out to be blessings in disguise. I also learned to distinguish between situations that are under our control and those that are beyond our control. The effort and work that went into the essays I submitted for the program were under my control but the ultimate decision was not and there was nothing I could do to change this. Thinking of the Serenity Prayer helps ground me when I lose sight of the distinction: "Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."
