				<h2> Values and Affirmation </h2>
				<h3> June 3, 2014 by Hilary </h3>
		<p>

	Stereotype threat is the risk of behaving in line with a stereotype about one's group when the group is brought to one's attention. Being aware of the stereotype creates an anxiety that can impair performance, thus resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the stereotype is filled. 

</br></br>The value that I felt compelled to write about in my "Affirming Your Values" blog post was music because being a part of the band and orchestra was such an important part of my happiness growing up. Tying this to stereotype threat, practicing my instruments may activate the "band geek" stereotype in my mind. This is a positive thing because this stereotype makes me think of intelligence, quirkiness, and community. 

</br></br> While I have created a positive association with the "bank geek" stereotype in my mind, it was not always easy to because my classmates used to tease me for being in the band. I drew strength from reminding myself how much I enjoyed being a part of the band. Not caring what other people think is an important way to avoid succumbing to the perils of stereotype threat.

</br></br>Any time I feel a negative stereotype threat being activated (i.e. that women are less intelligent), I can use affirmation to consciously remind myself that the stereotype is not true and repeat positive mantras. 

</br></br>Some other excerises that can help when I am feeling down at DBC include meditating or breathing; taking a break to dance; or reading a book to take a break from reality for a few minutes.
