<td><p> The CirrusMD website (specifically, the Patients component) uses videoconferencing to solve the problem of having difficulty accessing a doctor. The ease of using this service is emphasized by the large image of a patient booking an appointment below the header. When you scroll below the image to the content, a navigation bar remains at the top of the page, making it easy to switch between the different types of content.This eliminates the visual challenge of having to scroll to the top to change sections. Within each section of the content, there are several links which display different content within the same frame. This eliminates the need to constantly upload new pages. </p></td>

<td><p> MyAutismTeam (specifically, the "Activity" page that appears after a user logs in) provides a social network for parents of children with autism to address the problem of loneliness and not knowing which providers to choose. The navigation bar at the top allows a user to quickly switch to the important components of the website: activity, find parents, provider directory, Q+A, pinboard, and mobile. The website has many components, so there is a visual challenge of making it possible for a user to quickly identify what they are looking for. This is done by separating the main sections in the header from the section on user information. The sidebar displays the user's information and breaks it down into the main categories of user information (i.e. my updates, my story). The content section includes the ability to post about how a user's day was and has an activity stream. </p></td>

<td><p> The Week is a news website that features articles on many different topics to address the problem of connecting people with news that they would find interesting in an efficient manner. The website does this by highlighting "speed reads" and most popular articles at the top of the content section. The largest visual challenge The Week faces is balancing its content with advertisements, which take up a sizable portion of the page. Also, The Week places many pictures next to article titles to prevent the design from being too flooded with text. </p></td>
