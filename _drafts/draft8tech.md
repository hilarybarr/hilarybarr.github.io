How Technology Is Improving Mental Healthcare

I chose to write about how technology is improving mental healthcare because my fascination with this is what led me to study software engineering. This post will address telepsychiatry, virtual reality, robotics, and social networks.


Telepsychiatry:
Virtual doctors visits. Over 50 million Americans live over 60 miles from the nearest specialist, and over 85% of psychiatric visits can be conducted online. Moreover, insurance reimburses this in many states. Medicare, Medicaid in most states, and private insurance in about 19 states mandated. Employers interested in this too.

Virtual Reality:
-Institute for Creative Technologies
-PTSD and even autism
-Insight Telepsychiatry has a product suite INworld Solutions that offers avatar-based therapy.

Robotics:
Social robots can be used in therapy. Academic research. Yale found a robot Pleo helped kids with autism. Work by Cindy Bethel at University of Mississippi can help abuse victims.

Social Networks:

It is only the beginning.
