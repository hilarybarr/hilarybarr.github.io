        <div class="well">  My name's Hilary Barr. My passion is using technology to improve mental healthcare, especially for children. I have a background in Cognitive Science and Neuropsychology and have done business development in the telemedicine space. I'm currently studying software engineering so that I can build new healthcare technologies. The languages I'm exploring include HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Ruby on Rails.</div>
