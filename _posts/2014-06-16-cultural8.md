When I first learned how large of an emphasis on pair programming there is in both Dev Bootcamp and in the real world, I was a bit anxious because I thought that it would be less productive than working on my own. I was surprised and delighted to find that I learned more in each hour of pairing than I would have learned in perhaps three hours of working on my own. This is because pairing exposes the gaps in your knowledge by forcing you to explain your thought processes. The roles of teacher and learner are constantly switched in a stimulating interplay, resulting in both partners growing over the course of a session. 

Along with enhancing my technical aptitude, I was happy to discover how enjoyable pairing is socially. I had the opportunity to interact with fascinating, kind classmates from all different backgrounds and enjoyed getting to know every one of them. It was also refreshing to talk to others who understood what I am going through since only a fellow boot could truly empathize with what it is like to participate in a software bootcamp.

Pairing also results in the opportunity to practice giving and receiving feedback. At Dev Bootcamp, we learn how to give feedback that is actionable, specific, and kind. My classmates have been doing such an outstanding job that I found it challenging to come up with actionable feedback. Reading my partners' feedback was encouraging and inspired me to keep working hard. 

I am excited to continue pairing at Dev Bootcamp and can't believe how far we've all come in just a few months.
