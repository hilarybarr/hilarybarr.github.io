#### Values
When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following are some of the values that come to mind: achievement, adventure, affection, close relationships, commitment, community, compassion, economic security, enthusiasm, excitement, freedom, friendships, having a family, helping other people, helping society, honesty, independence, inspiration, loyalty, music, nature, spirituality 

#### Music
Music is important to me not only because I have always enjoyed listening to it and playing instruments but because it has been a large part of my social life. In middle and high school, the band and orchestra were where I met many of my best friends. Hanging out in the music classrooms was always a respite for me. Incorporating music into mentoring programs I have been involved with has also allowed me to help children with special needs. 

#### Live It Up
On a scale of 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree), I agree that I try to live up to the values listed above.

#### Advice
The last topic someone asked for my advice on was their love life :-)
